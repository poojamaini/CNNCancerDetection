## General Information
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Conclusions
#Findings

#Model 1: First we built the model without data augmentation.We saw that the model was overfitting. 

#Model 2: Then we did data augmentation and saw how the overfitting issue became better.

#Model 3: Finally we tried to balance classes with the help of augmenter library and saw that our overfitting issue got resolved with the model giving a good accuracy over 
#training and validation set.
#Also there is not much difference in the accuracies of both the training and validation set
#34s 195ms/step - loss: 0.2579 - accuracy: 0.9099 - val_loss: 0.7791 - val_accuracy: 0.8099
